codeplex-for-strider
====================

A codeplex provider for strider-cd

As of right now, it can be loaded into strider, and connect to codeplex via OAuth. You will even see your repositories, but can not do anything else with them.

This is an ongoing project, that I am using as a way to learn node.

If, for some strange reason you want to follow along, you can follow the progress at http://gettinggui.com
